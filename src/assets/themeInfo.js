			'It all started back in 1988, when a group of students at Studentersamfundet had an idea of creating an international student festival to gather students from all over the world to create unity between students across borders. \n\nSince the very beginning, ISFiT has held a wide program of cultural events providing entertainment to both the international audience and the citizens of Trondheim. The cultural program of ISFiT consists of concerts, scene art, meetings and ceremonies. Through the cultural program, ISFiT wishes to create a venue where the participants get the opportunity to break through cultural barriers. During the festival there will also be workshops. These are smaller workgroups where participants will be discussing and sharing their views on topics related to the theme. Right before the festival kicks off in Trondheim there will be held dialogue groups where participants will meet to understand their situation and how to use dialogue as a tool. The dialogue groups have been running since 1997, and have spanned various conflicts and countries since that time.\n\nA year later, in 1998, the students of ISFiT began to wonder why the Nobel Peace Prize was never awarded to students. This was the beginning of the Student Peace Prize. The Student Peace Prize will be handed out during the festival, to a student or student organization that strives towards peace and understanding rather than violence.\n\nOver the years a number of significant people have visited the festival, including Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Dalai Lama, Chai Ling, Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, Desmond Tutu, Betty Williams and numerous others.',

			"In the Norwegian TV show “fra bølle til bestevenn\", bully dogs are trained to become the family’s best friend. Some of the dogs have simple behavior problems, other dogs have serious problems with aggression that might become dangerous. One of them is the German Shepard Dexter, he is scared and acts out aggressively, in the worst cases he can snap and bite at humans with very little encouragement. During the TV show he becomes less scared and aggressive, but not completely. The dog trainer says that if 5% of him is still aggressive after intensive training, that 5% can be the part that causes serious injury, that 5% can’t be there if he is going to live.\n\nWe have come a long way to go when it comes to equal rights. In a lot of ways women and men are equal. We have the same rights, the same right to vote, the same right to higher education, both men and women are drafted to the military and we are starting to get more women in leadership. We are getting closer to equal rights, but if 5% of our society is still oppressing marginalized groups to a dangerous point, the consequences might be fatal. Even though our rights are equal, our privileges are not equal. Prejudices and internalised values are still blocking the way to an equal society.\n\nNorway is on the top of most lists of equal rights, that doesn’t make us equal. We have one of the most segregated labor markets of the developed countries. Women work in healthcare, caring professions and the municipal sector, while men work in industry, IT and the private sector. It’s hard to find a cause for this, it might be a combination of things. Traditionally women have taken care of kids, the sick and elderly. In modern times with the Norwegian welfare state these responsibilities have become paid work. Therefore in Norway, women do the same work as before, but are getting paid for it, but are paid less than men. Few men switch to stereotypical women's work and few women are switching to stereotypical men's work.\n\nEqual rights are measured by the country’s economy, health care systems and welfare, not just by equality. Norway scores really high in these areas, so even though we have a very segregated labor market we are still considered equal. This can hide the equality problems behind the welfare system. Which rights are the most important? Is it be equal or to have a good health care system? This can also be looked at with a wider lens by looking at other countries. In Bangladesh women have the right to vote, but child marriage is still quite common, especially in rural areas, and the rights to abortion are restrictive. What’s more important, the right to have a small impact in elections or the right to have a normal childhood and the rights over your own body? We have a long way to go to get equal rights in the world, as well as in Norway.\n\nIn a modern Norwegian family the parents try to be equal by sharing the bills, dividing the housework and trying to raise the kids equally. A lot of Norwegian parents work towards raising their kids without the gender forms. They proudly say that they are taking away the barbie dolls, the princesses and the pink because their children are not just their gender. What’s left when the parents do this? Stereotypical boy toys, cars, dinosaurs, Lego and action figures. A girl playing with action figures is so cool! But a boy playing with dolls is not? By removing the feminine toys the parents are undermining their children’s femininity. Equal rights means that the feminine and masculine are equal, not that one is better than the other. These prejudices are transferred to adult life. Women that have stereotypical male hobbies are seen as “cool” while men with stereotypical female hobbies are seen as weird and different. A woman playing football, doing sports, gaming and rock climbing is very “cool,” because she is not doing typical feminine things. A man dancing ballet, who is into fashion, makeup and needlework is seen as different, weird and has his sexuality questioned. Why doesn’t stereotypical feminine hobbies make him cool?\n\nIn workspaces with only men the environment can easily become toxic, it can be very contest concentrated, with complete disregard of each other's feelings. In women concentrated workspaces it can be a lot of backbiting, and conflict. In a workspace with both men and women the climate is a lot better. Both parties support each other, bring out the best in each other and create a good climate. The women stop the contests and bullying, the men stop the backtalking. We bring out the best in each other. This is why we need a more equal workforce, it’s so much better to work in an equal workspace for both men and women.\n\nImagine you are standing at an intersection. One road is called racism, another called sexism. The dangers of you getting hit by a car is bigger than if you are standing by one road. Intersectional feminism is a newer form of feminism and shows that sexism isn’t the only form of oppression. Intersectional feminism focuses on all forms of oppression against marginalized groups like gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, class, disability, indigenous groups etc. Are we an equal society if black women are still subject to racism? If disabled people are treated badly?\n\nSome people belong to several marginalized groups and experience mistreatment from several factors. If some marginalised group keeps being treated unfair the rest of society is not equal. Another way to look at intersectionality is to imagine cooking a stew. By adding ingredients the stew turns different, some ingredients don't do much, others do. Adding carrots might not change the stew much, but adding too much coriander makes a lot of people dislike it. All the different ingredients impact each other and the outcome. A gay black woman can be treated a lot different than a gay white man. A person can be oppressed and privileged at the same time. Intersectional feminism and the fourth wave feminism focuses on this. It’s a fight for all marginalised groups, because if everyone fights together the small groups become bigger and stronger. An equal society is a society where gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and ability level doesn't change your privileges and conditions.",

			'There is no power like celebrity power. The power of your favourite entertainers often stretches far beyond curtain call, as their opinions may persuade us regular folk to buy certain products, support specific causes, and perhaps even vote for certain political candidates. However, as stated by French philosopher Voltaire, as well as Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben, “with great power comes great responsibility”. With the rise of cancel culture, several celebrities are being confronted with the ways in which they have wielded their star-power and are met with demands of accountability, apologies, and a shift in their endorsements, to remain in a position of cultural power.\n\nSo how does a celebrity stay in power? It is really quite simple; they have to say the correct things, about the correct events, at the correct time, in the correct manner. Now, a pessimist may argue that it surely must be easier to say nothing at all. While this is a strategy employed by an increasing number of famous figures, this avoidance may also receive criticism, or worse – a loss of relevance. Nevertheless, with this asphyxiating pressure of activism becoming fame’s natural companion, losing one’s celebrity power may feel more liberating than ruining. By letting their relevance slowly slip into oblivion, the now used-to-be celebrity may return to the poolside with their champagne glass, their quiet, and their ridiculous wealth – and never have a care in the world ever again. Right?\n\nThe reality behind the celebrity lifestyle is less glamorous than the picture previously painted. Numerous documentaries, speaking-out articles and social media strings have revealed a darker reality behind the world of show business as we know it, not unlike Plato’s allegory of the cave. While we were blinded by glitter and glory, great artists of multiple generations were victim to abuse and general mistreatment – behind the scenes. Many celebrities are now speaking up, trying to convince their audience that they were never as powerful as it seemed. In the wake of these revelations, the power of the audience has yet again been reevaluated. Do our parasocial expectations of and to celebrity power enable the systematic disempowerment of our favourite artists? Important questions are being raised regarding the blurred lines between person and product, as well as questions regarding whether a sustainable, humane power dynamic is in fact feasible within the idea of celebrity culture, or if the concepts are simply dissonant.\n\nAnd yet, many of these celebrities live luxurious lives that the average person could only dream of. They are living a dream which we, the consumers, paid for. They have a power, which we gave them. If it is ours to give, is it then not ours to take? To control? The power paradox which defines celebrity culture is complex, and the questions asked in this article do not have clear, definite answers. However, it is important that they are discussed, as the neglect of this conversation has caused hurt and abuse to both parties. Conclusively, one might read my introductory statement with a more negative, interpretive tone: there is no power like celebrity power.',

			'Many movements and communities have been built around marginalised groups and the goal of empowerment, spurting new terminology such as black power, queer power, and girl power. In recent public discourse, a new group is seeking to participate in the empowerment movement: straight, white men. The reaction given to these voices requires reflection regarding our understanding of empowerment and begs the question: is participation in empowerment-culture an open invite? A prominent reason for the scepticism of straight, white men in spaces of empowerment, is the position of power this group has possessed in greater parts of modern, western history. As a result, they have been identified as the antagonists of many empowerment initiatives. It seems strange, and perhaps destructive, to invite former oppressors into one’s space of freedom. Although many fights for empowerment have come a long way, and society in general is more welcoming of diversity and equality than previous generations, the fear that it may be taken away is still highly present. This fear is also not unwarranted, as recent political shifts indicate that this progress may be in danger, with many extreme political parties gaining power around the globe during the 2020’s, fronting agendas hostile to historically marginalised groups such as LGBT+, and indigenous peoples, among others.\n\nHowever, assuming that the group ‘straight, white men’ is inherently different from others is also a direction which could negatively impact the general empowerment culture. Firstly, because such thinking dangerously dances on the edges of the same bigoted thinking which has, and continues to, motivate the oppression of other groups. Secondly, if the inclusion of straight, white men in empowerment culture goes against its very foundations, one may question these foundations. One could then argue that rather than empowering marginalised groups within the existing society, there was simply created a separate, parallel society in which the oppressing group was not included. If these separate societies never meet and eventually merge, the imbalanced power dynamics of the first society will always remain. Lastly, if empowerment culture seeks to strengthen groups who are left out in society, is it not hypocritical to exclude straight, white men?\n\nHowever, is it in fact true that white, straight men are excluded from empowerment culture? There are straight, white men present in empowerment-focused activities and events such as Pride and International Women’s Day. Thus, it is not impossible for individuals of this group to participate in empowerment culture. Still, many straight, white men feel unwelcome in these spaces. Ironically, fear may yet again play a leading role. Individuals of this historically antagonistic group may fear accusations of being “the bad guy” and not actually being welcomed in the conversation beyond apologies and reparations, when entering the spaces of empowerment culture. This fear and defensiveness may then translate to feelings of exclusion and negative attitudes towards the participants of empowerment culture. Whether one agrees with the reasoning for these feelings or not, does not make the feelings less real for the experiencer, and should be taken seriously.\n\nUltimately, everyone wants to feel like they belong. As different groups have joined and developed empowerment culture, they have also created a community which share positive sentiments, encouragements, and support among each other. The fact that some straight, white men utter distress about feeling excluded from this company is, in a way, also a compliment to the movement. A little bravery from both sides may engender a more inclusive empowerment culture. Let’s ensure that participation in empowerment culture is an open invite.',

			'Voices for Change: The Student Peace Prize and Its Global Influence',

			'Since 1999, the Student Peace Prize has been awarded every two years to students and student organizations committed to promoting peace, human rights and democracy. The prize was founded by volunteers from the International Student Festival in Trondheim (ISFiT), and has been awarded during ISFiT’s award ceremony ever since. Today, the prize stands as a global symbol of peace and solidarity, but what significance does the Student Peace Prize hold in today’s turbulent world?\n\n**Cultural and Diplomatic Soft Power**\n\nThe award ceremony might appear passive, but plays an undeniably significant role in promoting peace, human rights and democracy on a global scale by embodying and bestowing soft power. Unlike hard power, which compels action through coercion and force, soft power relies on influence and persuasion to inspire voluntary action. With its prestige and media attention, the prize’s soft power lies in its ability to draw global attention to causes that might otherwise be overlooked. Beyond the financial support, winners themselves gain a form of soft power through the international networks and worldwide audience the prize connects them with. This influence serves as a diplomatic tool, fostering solidarity across borders, shaping global opinions, influencing diplomatic relations, and applying pressure for reforms in oppressive regimes.\n\n**A Platform for Marginalized Voices**\n\nThe awardees are often unpredictable and surprising, reflecting the shifting global priorities and the wide range of causes, emerging movements, and oppressed or marginalized voices. By making controversial or bold choices, the prize challenges powerful systems and the status quo, provoking reactions and debates that keep it relevant and dynamic. The global coverage of the prize amplifies the awardees’ voices, allowing them to share their message and work towards peace. This visibility can raise awareness of critical issues such as conflicts and social injustice, facilitate commentary and criticism of nations and situations, and encourage positive change. In turn, this fosters international solidarity and power across cultural and national boundaries and enables marginalized voices to be heard, influencing policymakers and challenging power structures.\n\n**Student Activism**\n\nUNICEF highlights that in recent decades there has been a significant increase in global protests led by students and youth. These protests tend to be larger, less violent, more inclusive and more innovative. This, according to UNICEF, challenges misperceptions of young protesters as violent and unruly, and results in a greater impact and a higher likelihood of positive outcomes. However, governments often respond preemptively and violently to these protests, and even when they succeed, such movements do not always lead to direct improvements for the youth. The Student Peace Prize seeks to recognize and empower these young activists, enabling them to continue and expand their peacebuilding initiatives, while inspiring other young people to take action and show their support in efforts to change the world.\n\n**The Future of Youth Activism**\n\nThe Student Peace Prize has grown into a globally recognized symbol of the importance of peace, human rights, and student activism, making it a unique award on the world stage for young activists. As we become more interconnected through digitalization, the youth will play an even greater role in shaping the future. Today, you can find the names and nationalities of all winners since 1999 inscribed on plaques in Jomfrugata, Trondheim. These plaques serve as reminders of our ongoing struggle against injustice and the need to foster solidarity, peace and equality. The Student Peace Prize will continue to be at the forefront of recognizing and empowering these efforts toward a better future for everyone.',

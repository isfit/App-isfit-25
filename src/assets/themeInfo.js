			'It all started back in 1988, when a group of students at Studentersamfundet had an idea of creating an international student festival to gather students from all over the world to create unity between students across borders. \n\nSince the very beginning, ISFiT has held a wide program of cultural events providing entertainment to both the international audience and the citizens of Trondheim. The cultural program of ISFiT consists of concerts, scene art, meetings and ceremonies. Through the cultural program, ISFiT wishes to create a venue where the participants get the opportunity to break through cultural barriers. During the festival there will also be workshops. These are smaller workgroups where participants will be discussing and sharing their views on topics related to the theme. Right before the festival kicks off in Trondheim there will be held dialogue groups where participants will meet to understand their situation and how to use dialogue as a tool. The dialogue groups have been running since 1997, and have spanned various conflicts and countries since that time.\n\nA year later, in 1998, the students of ISFiT began to wonder why the Nobel Peace Prize was never awarded to students. This was the beginning of the Student Peace Prize. The Student Peace Prize will be handed out during the festival, to a student or student organization that strives towards peace and understanding rather than violence.\n\nOver the years a number of significant people have visited the festival, including Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Dalai Lama, Chai Ling, Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, Desmond Tutu, Betty Williams and numerous others.',

			'In the Norwegian TV show “Fra bølle til bestevenn” troublesome dogs are trained to become well-behaved family pets. Some dogs have minor behavior issues, while others, like the German Shepherd Dexter, struggle with serious aggression. Dexter is fearful and can act aggressively, even biting people with little provocation. Although he improves with training, the trainer notes that even a small percentage of residual aggression could still make him dangerous.\n\nDespite advancements in equality, true equal rights remain elusive. While men and women now have similar rights, like voting, military service, and leadership opportunities, underlying privileges and biases persist. Norway, a leader in equality, still has a highly segregated labor market, with women in care roles and men in private sectors like IT. This divide often reflects traditional roles, where women now perform paid caregiving jobs but generally earn less than men in male-dominated fields.\n\nNorway’s high equality rankings may mask persistent issues, as such rankings consider economic stability, healthcare, and welfare systems as part of equality. While Norway has a segregated labor market, countries with fewer social protections often face harsher disparities, such as child marriage in Bangladesh. Thus, the question arises: is formal equality or a robust welfare system more critical?\n\nModern Norwegian parents often aim for gender-neutral upbringing by avoiding stereotypical gendered toys. However, this approach sometimes unintentionally favors masculine toys while rejecting feminine ones, reinforcing biases. Society often celebrates women engaging in “masculine” hobbies as “cool,” while men pursuing “feminine” activities, like fashion or dance, face judgment. True equality should value both femininity and masculinity equally.\n\nIn workplaces dominated by one gender, unhealthy dynamics can emerge: all-male environments may become highly competitive, while all-female ones may struggle with backbiting. A mixed-gender workplace often fosters a healthier, balanced atmosphere, where men and women mitigate each other’s excesses and encourage collaboration. This demonstrates the need for a more gender-balanced workforce.\n\nIntersectional feminism expands on traditional feminism by addressing multiple layers of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and ableism. Imagine standing at the intersection of “racism” and “sexism”—the risk of harm increases. Intersectional feminism advocates for marginalized groups, such as disabled individuals or people of color, to unite for collective strength. An equal society is one where factors like gender, race, orientation, and ability do not determine privilege or treatment.\n\nSome individuals belong to multiple marginalized groups, compounding their experiences of discrimination. Intersectionality highlights how a gay Black woman may face distinct challenges from a gay white man, showcasing that one can simultaneously experience privilege and oppression. By uniting these groups, intersectional feminism strives for a society where no single characteristic dictates one`s life conditions.',

			'There is no power like celebrity power. The power of your favourite entertainers often stretches far beyond curtain call, as their opinions may persuade us regular folk to buy certain products, support specific causes, and perhaps even vote for certain political candidates. However, as stated by French philosopher Voltaire, as well as Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben, “with great power comes great responsibility”. With the rise of cancel culture, several celebrities are being confronted with the ways in which they have wielded their star-power and are met with demands of accountability, apologies, and a shift in their endorsements, to remain in a position of cultural power.\n\nSo how does a celebrity stay in power? It is really quite simple; they have to say the correct things, about the correct events, at the correct time, in the correct manner. Now, a pessimist may argue that it surely must be easier to say nothing at all. While this is a strategy employed by an increasing number of famous figures, this avoidance may also receive criticism, or worse – a loss of relevance. Nevertheless, with this asphyxiating pressure of activism becoming fame’s natural companion, losing one’s celebrity power may feel more liberating than ruining. By letting their relevance slowly slip into oblivion, the now used-to-be celebrity may return to the poolside with their champagne glass, their quiet, and their ridiculous wealth – and never have a care in the world ever again. Right?\n\nThe reality behind the celebrity lifestyle is less glamorous than the picture previously painted. Numerous documentaries, speaking-out articles and social media strings have revealed a darker reality behind the world of show business as we know it, not unlike Plato’s allegory of the cave. While we were blinded by glitter and glory, great artists of multiple generations were victim to abuse and general mistreatment – behind the scenes. Many celebrities are now speaking up, trying to convince their audience that they were never as powerful as it seemed. In the wake of these revelations, the power of the audience has yet again been reevaluated. Do our parasocial expectations of and to celebrity power enable the systematic disempowerment of our favourite artists? Important questions are being raised regarding the blurred lines between person and product, as well as questions regarding whether a sustainable, humane power dynamic is in fact feasible within the idea of celebrity culture, or if the concepts are simply dissonant.\n\nAnd yet, many of these celebrities live luxurious lives that the average person could only dream of. They are living a dream which we, the consumers, paid for. They have a power, which we gave them. If it is ours to give, is it then not ours to take? To control? The power paradox which defines celebrity culture is complex, and the questions asked in this article do not have clear, definite answers. However, it is important that they are discussed, as the neglect of this conversation has caused hurt and abuse to both parties. Conclusively, one might read my introductory statement with a more negative, interpretive tone: there is no power like celebrity power.',

			'Many movements and communities have been built around marginalised groups and the goal of empowerment, spurting new terminology such as black power, queer power, and girl power. In recent public discourse, a new group is seeking to participate in the empowerment movement: straight, white men. The reaction given to these voices requires reflection regarding our understanding of empowerment and begs the question: is participation in empowerment-culture an open invite? A prominent reason for the scepticism of straight, white men in spaces of empowerment, is the position of power this group has possessed in greater parts of modern, western history. As a result, they have been identified as the antagonists of many empowerment initiatives. It seems strange, and perhaps destructive, to invite former oppressors into one’s space of freedom. Although many fights for empowerment have come a long way, and society in general is more welcoming of diversity and equality than previous generations, the fear that it may be taken away is still highly present. This fear is also not unwarranted, as recent political shifts indicate that this progress may be in danger, with many extreme political parties gaining power around the globe during the 2020’s, fronting agendas hostile to historically marginalised groups such as LGBT+, and indigenous peoples, among others.\n\nHowever, assuming that the group ‘straight, white men’ is inherently different from others is also a direction which could negatively impact the general empowerment culture. Firstly, because such thinking dangerously dances on the edges of the same bigoted thinking which has, and continues to, motivate the oppression of other groups. Secondly, if the inclusion of straight, white men in empowerment culture goes against its very foundations, one may question these foundations. One could then argue that rather than empowering marginalised groups within the existing society, there was simply created a separate, parallel society in which the oppressing group was not included. If these separate societies never meet and eventually merge, the imbalanced power dynamics of the first society will always remain. Lastly, if empowerment culture seeks to strengthen groups who are left out in society, is it not hypocritical to exclude straight, white men?\n\nHowever, is it in fact true that white, straight men are excluded from empowerment culture? There are straight, white men present in empowerment-focused activities and events such as Pride and International Women’s Day. Thus, it is not impossible for individuals of this group to participate in empowerment culture. Still, many straight, white men feel unwelcome in these spaces. Ironically, fear may yet again play a leading role. Individuals of this historically antagonistic group may fear accusations of being “the bad guy” and not actually being welcomed in the conversation beyond apologies and reparations, when entering the spaces of empowerment culture. This fear and defensiveness may then translate to feelings of exclusion and negative attitudes towards the participants of empowerment culture. Whether one agrees with the reasoning for these feelings or not, does not make the feelings less real for the experiencer, and should be taken seriously.\n\nUltimately, everyone wants to feel like they belong. As different groups have joined and developed empowerment culture, they have also created a community which share positive sentiments, encouragements, and support among each other. The fact that some straight, white men utter distress about feeling excluded from this company is, in a way, also a compliment to the movement. A little bravery from both sides may engender a more inclusive empowerment culture. Let’s ensure that participation in empowerment culture is an open invite.',

			'Voices for Change: The Student Peace Prize and Its Global Influence',

			'Since 1999, the Student Peace Prize has been awarded every two years to students and student organizations committed to promoting peace, human rights and democracy. The prize was founded by volunteers from the International Student Festival in Trondheim (ISFiT), and has been awarded during ISFiT’s award ceremony ever since. Today, the prize stands as a global symbol of peace and solidarity, but what significance does the Student Peace Prize hold in today’s turbulent world?\n\n**Cultural and Diplomatic Soft Power**\n\nThe award ceremony might appear passive, but plays an undeniably significant role in promoting peace, human rights and democracy on a global scale by embodying and bestowing soft power. Unlike hard power, which compels action through coercion and force, soft power relies on influence and persuasion to inspire voluntary action. With its prestige and media attention, the prize’s soft power lies in its ability to draw global attention to causes that might otherwise be overlooked. Beyond the financial support, winners themselves gain a form of soft power through the international networks and worldwide audience the prize connects them with. This influence serves as a diplomatic tool, fostering solidarity across borders, shaping global opinions, influencing diplomatic relations, and applying pressure for reforms in oppressive regimes.\n\n**A Platform for Marginalized Voices**\n\nThe awardees are often unpredictable and surprising, reflecting the shifting global priorities and the wide range of causes, emerging movements, and oppressed or marginalized voices. By making controversial or bold choices, the prize challenges powerful systems and the status quo, provoking reactions and debates that keep it relevant and dynamic. The global coverage of the prize amplifies the awardees’ voices, allowing them to share their message and work towards peace. This visibility can raise awareness of critical issues such as conflicts and social injustice, facilitate commentary and criticism of nations and situations, and encourage positive change. In turn, this fosters international solidarity and power across cultural and national boundaries and enables marginalized voices to be heard, influencing policymakers and challenging power structures.\n\n**Student Activism**\n\nUNICEF highlights that in recent decades there has been a significant increase in global protests led by students and youth. These protests tend to be larger, less violent, more inclusive and more innovative. This, according to UNICEF, challenges misperceptions of young protesters as violent and unruly, and results in a greater impact and a higher likelihood of positive outcomes. However, governments often respond preemptively and violently to these protests, and even when they succeed, such movements do not always lead to direct improvements for the youth. The Student Peace Prize seeks to recognize and empower these young activists, enabling them to continue and expand their peacebuilding initiatives, while inspiring other young people to take action and show their support in efforts to change the world.\n\n**The Future of Youth Activism**\n\nThe Student Peace Prize has grown into a globally recognized symbol of the importance of peace, human rights, and student activism, making it a unique award on the world stage for young activists. As we become more interconnected through digitalization, the youth will play an even greater role in shaping the future. Today, you can find the names and nationalities of all winners since 1999 inscribed on plaques in Jomfrugata, Trondheim. These plaques serve as reminders of our ongoing struggle against injustice and the need to foster solidarity, peace and equality. The Student Peace Prize will continue to be at the forefront of recognizing and empowering these efforts toward a better future for everyone.',

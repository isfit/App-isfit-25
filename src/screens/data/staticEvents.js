			'Sunday the 12th of February from 10.00 pm – 11.30 pm the Nidaros Cathedral will be at the disposal of the ISFiT-participants, the hosts and all others who want to join us. We are invited to make it our own sanctuary – a place for reflection, meditation, thanksgiving, prayers and acts of community. This night we can experience being silent together, listening to music, enjoying the feeling of unity and fellowship –no matter faith. All are invited to express their own faith, struggles and hopes – in a Silent Night. The Silent Night is arranged by the University Chaplaincy in Trondheim, in cooperation with ISFiT.',

			"The Student Peace Prize welcomes you to meet this year's winner of the Student Peace Prize, DOXA! They receive the award on the basis of their courageous work to expose corruption and sexual harassment at universities, report on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, document state persecution and fight against state propaganda. Despite Putin's persistent attempts to silence all critical voices, Russian independent journalism continues to thrive. The student magazine DOXA has emerged as an important voice for a younger generation of Russians and has played an important role in challenging and criticizing the regime. We invite you to an exciting meeting with the editors of DOXA! What is it like to be a student activist in Russia? How does DOXA continue its work with critical journalism despite a shrinking space? And how do they envision the future for young people in Russia?",
